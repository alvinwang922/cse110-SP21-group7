## Flow with RIVER
We are team 7 for the 2021 spring quarter of CSE110! We identify as team RIVER, which stands for: Reflection, Improvement, Values, Empowerment, Refinement.

- **R**eflection. We value the ability to make observations on the past successes and failures of ourselves and our peers. In order to grow as individuals, we owe it to ourselves to maintain a strong degree of retrospection to learn from the past.
- **I**mprovement. We oppose the idea of reaching a point where we are "good enough". On a social and technical level, we strongly value the ability to constantly better ourselves.
- **V**alues. Regardless of what we pursue, we prioritize the ability to uphold a strong moral compass.
- **E**mpowerment. All forms of writing are self-empowering, and give us greater control over our mental wellbeing.
- **R**efinement. Maintaining a bullet journal fosters coherence and brevity in our writing: two characteristics that help us better organize our thoughts.

Ultimately, we identify as team RIVER because these are values that are intrinsic to maintaining a bullet journal. Similar to how writing allows us to channel our thoughts, RIVER allows your ideas, time management skills, and personal notes to flow seamlessly.
